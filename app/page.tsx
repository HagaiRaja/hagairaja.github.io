Armed with a masterâ€™s degree from Sejong University (4.5 GPA, Iâ€™m serious!), Iâ€™ve spent the last few years developing AI solutions for satellite imagery and remote sensing, making sure our planet is mapped better than ever!`}

Alongside AI, Iâ€™ve dabbled in finance, startups, and politics. Also, did I mention I love tackling AI challenges? From ESA to KARI, Iâ€™m always testing new algorithms in global competitions.`}
